BBC iPlayer Beta (Nuvola app)
==========================

Integration of BBC iPlayer into your linux desktop via
[Nuvola Apps Runtime](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime).

This is a beta release: support for HTML5 Media Source Extensions (MSE) is new
to WebKitGtk and may be still incomplete. Most BBC content works, most of the
time, but not all. In those cases you can still use the Flash player, but
Nuvola will be unable to detect or control playing state.
